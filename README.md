I am working on integration of all open source electronics platform which will be easy to use for making projects and developing ideas. Aursun IDE is the Modified version of Arduino to build easy platform for students and it uses Arduino,Processing and AVR sources. I have modified and integrated all open source platfrom in Aursun-IDE so that it contains libraries of arduino, wiring and Aursun libraries for increasing its productivity.Aursun-IDE is Forked from arduino and processing. Aursun hardwares based on Arduino hardwares so its campatible with Arduino IDE. (This is Non Profit Organization for helping students and Researcher to making projects and products development) open source hardware & software commmunity

                       Aursun IDE forked from Arduino and libraries forked from  wiring & processing
